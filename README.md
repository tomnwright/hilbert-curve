# Hilberts Space-Filling Curve Algorithm
Python algorithm (using turtle for representation) for generating hilbert's space-filling curve

curveGen is the main program- it includes interpretation of generated Hilbert curves through turtle. However, I have also included a file containing only the generation algorithm.
